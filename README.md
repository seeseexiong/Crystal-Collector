# Crystal Collector Game
This is an interactive game on the web browser.
There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. Each crystal has a hidden value.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
To win, the player must click on the crystals and total their score to match with the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
